### ✅ Duplicate Clipping Analyzers (RESOLVED 2025-10-03)

**Previous Issue**: Two similar clipping analysis implementations existed:

1. **`core/converters/clippath_analyzer.py`** - `ClipPathAnalyzer` (348 lines) - DELETED
2. **`core/groups/clipping_analyzer.py`** - `ClippingAnalyzer` (533 lines) - KEPT

**Resolution**:
- Consolidated to single `ClippingAnalyzer` in `core/groups/`
- Added backward-compatible `analyze_clippath()` method to ClippingAnalyzer
- Migrated all 3 dependent files:
  - `core/converters/masking.py` ✅
  - `core/map/clipping_adapter.py` ✅
  - `core/converters/__init__.py` ✅
- Deleted obsolete `ClipPathAnalyzer`
- All E2E tests passing

**Savings**: ~348 lines of duplicate code eliminated
