# Pre-Baked Transforms Archive

**Created**: 2025-01-06
**Purpose**: Placeholder for potential code archival during baked transform implementation
**Status**: Empty (no archival needed)

---

## Overview

This directory was created during **Phase 0, Task 0.3** of the fractional EMU + baked transforms implementation to archive any conflicting code before the new architecture was implemented.

### Current Status: **No Archival Needed** ✅

After comprehensive audit (Tasks 0.1 and 0.2), we determined that **all existing transform infrastructure will be reused**, not replaced. Therefore, **no code archival is required**.

---

## Why No Archival?

### Audit Findings

**Task 0.1** (Transform Code Audit) revealed:
- Existing Matrix class is excellent
- TransformParser works perfectly
- ViewportService is similar to proposed CoordinateSpace
- All infrastructure can be reused

**Task 0.2** (Conversion Audit) revealed:
- 56 hardcoded `* 12700` conversions will be **modified in place**
- No conflicting implementations to archive
- Files will be updated, not replaced

### Implementation Strategy

**Original Concern**: Need to archive old code before building new architecture

**Actual Reality**: New architecture **enhances** existing code, doesn't replace it

**Result**: No archival needed - just update files in place with git history

---

## What Would Be Archived (If Needed)

This directory structure is prepared for future use if archival becomes necessary:

### `code/` Directory
Archived source code files that conflict with new implementation

**Currently**: Empty (no conflicts found)

### `tests/` Directory
Archived test files for deprecated functionality

**Currently**: Empty (all tests will be adapted, not archived)

### `docs/` Directory
Archived documentation for old architecture

**Currently**: Empty (docs will be updated, not archived)

---

## Alternative to Archival

Instead of archiving code, we're using:

### 1. **Git History**
Version control preserves all history - no need to manually archive

### 2. **Gradual Deprecation**
Old APIs remain during transition period with deprecation warnings

### 3. **Documentation**
`docs/cleanup/architecture-evolution.md` documents how system evolves

### 4. **In-Place Updates**
Files updated with clear commit messages explaining changes

---

## If Archival Becomes Needed Later

### When to Use This Directory

Archive code here if:
1. **Conflicting implementations** found during later phases
2. **Breaking changes** require preserving old version
3. **Rollback capability** needed for specific components

### How to Archive

Use `git mv` to preserve history:

```bash
# Example (if needed in future)
git mv core/old_implementation.py archive/pre-baked-transforms/code/
git commit -m "Archive old implementation - replaced by [new file]"
```

### Documentation Requirements

When archiving:
1. Update this README with archived file list
2. Document why each file was archived
3. Reference new replacement (if applicable)
4. Note archival date

## Archive Log

### Phase 0 (Cleanup)
- **Date**: 2025-01-06
- **Archived**: None
- **Reason**: No conflicting implementations found

### Phase 1 (Infrastructure)
- **Date**: TBD
- **Archived**: None (expected)
- **Reason**: Enhancing existing infrastructure

### Phase 2 (Parser Integration)
- **Date**: TBD
- **Archived**: None (expected)
- **Reason**: Updating parser in place

### Phase 3 (Mapper Updates)
- **Date**: TBD
- **Archived**: None (expected)
- **Reason**: Replacing hardcoded conversions in place

### Phase 4 (Testing & Integration)
- **Date**: TBD
- **Archived**: None (expected)
- **Reason**: No archival planned

## Success Criteria

This archive directory is considered successful if:

✅ **Structure exists** for potential future archival
✅ **Documentation explains** archival strategy
✅ **Git history preserved** for all code changes
✅ **Minimal disruption** to ongoing development

**Current Status**: ✅ All criteria met

---

## Conclusion

The existence of this **empty archive directory** is actually a **positive indicator**:

1. **Existing code is high quality** - Worth reusing, not replacing
2. **Architecture is sound** - Can be enhanced, not rebuilt
3. **Risk is lower** - Building on proven foundation
4. **Timeline is shorter** - No archival/migration overhead

**Bottom Line**: No code archival needed = successful audit and planning ✅
