# SVG2PPTX Mission (Lite)

SVG2PPTX bridges the gap between vector graphics and presentations by providing seamless SVG-to-PowerPoint conversion, specifically solving Google Apps users' inability to import SVG files directly into presentations.

Our key differentiator is offering cloud-deployable conversion through Python APIs while also providing Google Apps Script integration, making high-quality vector graphics accessible to all presentation platforms without compromising scalability or visual fidelity.
