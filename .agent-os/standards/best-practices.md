  READ: The following principles

## Core Principles

### Keep It Simple
- Implement code in the fewest lines possible
- Avoid over-engineering solutions
- Choose straightforward approaches over clever ones

### Optimize for Readability
- Prioritize code clarity over micro-optimizations
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Add comments for "why" not "what"

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Extract repeated business logic to private methods
- Extract repeated UI markup to reusable components
- Create utility functions for common operations

### File Structure
- Keep files focused on a single responsibility
- Group related functionality together
- Use consistent naming conventions

## üö® MANDATORY TESTING STANDARDS (Updated 2025-09-13)

### Unified Testing System - NO EXCEPTIONS
- ‚úÖ **MANDATORY**: `source venv/bin/activate` before ALL test operations
- ‚úÖ **ONLY** use `/tests/` unified structure with systematic templates
- ‚úÖ **ONLY** execute tests via `./venv/bin/python tests/run_tests.py`
- ‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Adhoc test scripts anywhere in project
- ‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Root directory test clutter or scattered test files
- ‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Custom test runners or direct pytest calls
- ‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: System Python or non-venv test execution

### Template-Based Development
- **MANDATORY**: Use `/tests/templates/` for all new test creation
- **MANDATORY**: Follow TODO placeholder structure in templates
- **MANDATORY**: Validate structure with `--check-structure` before development
- **MANDATORY**: Place tests in correct category directories

### Zero Tolerance Policy
Any violations result in immediate cleanup:
- Adhoc test scripts ‚Üí **DELETED**
- Root directory clutter ‚Üí **REMOVED**
- Non-unified testing ‚Üí **RESTRUCTURED**

### Current Standards
- 155 organized test files (consolidated from 273 scattered)
- Systematic templates for consistent development
- Tool-standardized architecture maintained
- Unified execution system enforced

## Dependencies

### Choose Libraries Wisely
When adding third-party dependencies:
- Select the most popular and actively maintained option
- Check the library's GitHub repository for:
  - Recent commits (within last 6 months)
  - Active issue resolution
  - Number of stars/downloads
  - Clear documentation
