# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-11-e2e-coverage-expansion/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

- **Real-World SVG Test Library**: Curated collection of 50+ SVG files exported from Figma, Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, and web-based tools covering diverse design patterns (geometric shapes, complex paths, text elements, gradients, filters, animations)
- **FastAPI E2E Test Framework**: Comprehensive test suite using pytest and httpx to test complete API workflows including multipart file upload, conversion processing, status polling, and PPTX download endpoints
- **Visual Fidelity Validation System**: Automated comparison framework using python-pptx to extract and validate converted content against expected outputs, including shape properties, text content, color values, and positioning
- **Converter Module Integration Testing**: Enhanced test scenarios that exercise all converter modules (shapes, paths, text, gradients, filters, animations, masking, markers) through real-world SVG files rather than synthetic test data
- **Regression Detection Pipeline**: CI/CD integration using GitHub Actions to run the complete E2E test suite on every pull request and commit, with failure notifications and coverage reporting
- **Coverage Tracking and Reporting**: Enhanced pytest-cov configuration to track converter module execution paths during E2E tests, generating detailed coverage reports showing which real-world scenarios exercise which code paths
- **Test Data Management**: Structured organization of SVG test files with metadata describing source tool, design complexity, and expected converter module usage for systematic testing
- **Error Scenario Validation**: Comprehensive testing of edge cases including malformed SVG files, unsupported features, large file handling, and proper error response formats through the API
