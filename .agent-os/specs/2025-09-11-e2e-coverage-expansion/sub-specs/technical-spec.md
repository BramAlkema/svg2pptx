# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-11-e2e-coverage-expansion/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Coverage Metrics and Targets
- **Overall E2E Coverage**: 90% minimum across all modules
- **API Endpoints**: 95% coverage including error paths and authentication flows
- **Core Conversion Logic**: 92% coverage of SVG parsing and PPTX generation
- **Integration Services**: 88% coverage of Google Drive and Slides API interactions
- **Error Handling**: 85% coverage of failure scenarios and edge cases

### Test Infrastructure Enhancements
- **Pytest Framework**: Leverage existing pytest configuration with E2E test markers
- **Test Data Management**: Comprehensive SVG sample library with real-world examples
- **Mocking Strategy**: Enhanced Google API mocks and network condition simulation
- **Parallel Execution**: Optimize test suite to run in under 10 minutes
- **Coverage Monitoring**: Automated pre-commit hooks and CI pipeline integration

### API Layer Testing Requirements
- **FastAPI Endpoints**: Complete coverage of /convert, /previews, and authentication routes
- **Request Validation**: Test all parameter combinations and validation errors
- **Authentication**: OAuth flow testing and API key validation scenarios
- **Rate Limiting**: Throttling behavior and quota management testing
- **CORS and Security**: Header validation and security policy enforcement

### Conversion Engine Testing Requirements
- **SVG Parser**: Valid and malformed SVG document handling
- **Element Converters**: All converter modules (shapes, paths, text, gradients, transforms)
- **Converter Registry**: Registration, lookup, and fallback behavior testing
- **Context Passing**: Data flow validation between converter stages
- **PPTX Generation**: Output structure and formatting validation

### Integration Testing Requirements
- **Google Services**: Drive API, Slides API, and OAuth authentication flows
- **File Operations**: Upload, download, and metadata management
- **Concurrent Processing**: Multi-threaded conversion and resource management
- **Error Propagation**: Service failure handling and recovery workflows
- **Performance Validation**: Memory usage and processing time thresholds

### Error Handling Testing Requirements
- **Input Validation**: Invalid SVG syntax and unsupported feature handling
- **System Errors**: Network failures, API quota limits, and resource exhaustion
- **Graceful Degradation**: Partial failure recovery and cleanup procedures
- **Security Testing**: Malicious input handling and injection prevention

### Performance and Quality Requirements
- **Test Execution Time**: Complete E2E suite runs in under 10 minutes
- **Memory Management**: Tests validate memory usage and cleanup
- **Flaky Test Prevention**: Deterministic test execution with proper setup/teardown
- **Coverage Quality**: Focus on meaningful scenarios rather than line coverage alone
- **Regression Prevention**: Automated coverage threshold enforcement in CI

### Monitoring and Reporting Requirements
- **Coverage Dashboard**: Real-time coverage metrics and trend analysis
- **HTML Reports**: Detailed coverage reports with drill-down capabilities
- **CI Integration**: Pull request coverage reporting and regression alerts
- **Team Notifications**: Coverage threshold violations and quality metrics

## External Dependencies (Conditional)

This specification builds upon existing testing infrastructure and does not require new external dependencies. The implementation will leverage:

- **pytest**: Already configured with comprehensive marker system
- **pytest-cov**: Existing coverage measurement and reporting
- **pytest-xdist**: For parallel test execution optimization
- **httpx**: For FastAPI client testing (already in use)
- **Google API libraries**: Already integrated for service testing
