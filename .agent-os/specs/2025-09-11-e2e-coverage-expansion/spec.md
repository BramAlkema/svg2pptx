> Spec: E2E Coverage Expansion to 90%
> Created: 2025-09-11

## Overview

Expand End-to-End test coverage for the SVG2PPTX project to achieve the target of 90% coverage across all critical system components. This initiative will strengthen quality assurance, reduce production bugs, and ensure comprehensive validation of conversion workflows from SVG input to PowerPoint output.

## User Stories

### Quality Assurance Engineer Story
As a QA engineer, I want comprehensive E2E test coverage so that I can confidently validate that all SVG conversion scenarios work correctly before releases.

The QA team needs to test complete user workflows including API endpoints, file uploads, conversion processing, Google Drive integration, and preview generation. Current coverage gaps leave critical paths untested, creating risk for production issues.

### Developer Story  
As a developer, I want reliable E2E tests so that I can refactor and enhance the codebase without fear of breaking existing functionality.

Developers need confidence that changes to converter modules, API endpoints, or integration services won't introduce regressions. Comprehensive E2E coverage provides this safety net while enabling rapid development.

### Product Manager Story
As a product manager, I want measurable quality metrics so that I can track product stability and make informed decisions about feature releases.

Having 90% E2E coverage provides quantifiable quality metrics that support release decisions and demonstrate product maturity to stakeholders and users.

## Spec Scope

1. **API Endpoint Testing** - Comprehensive coverage of all FastAPI endpoints including authentication, conversion, and preview generation
2. **Core Conversion Logic** - Complete testing of SVG parsing, element conversion, and PPTX generation workflows  
3. **Integration Services** - Full coverage of Google Drive, Google Slides API, and OAuth authentication flows
4. **Error Handling Scenarios** - Comprehensive testing of edge cases, malformed inputs, and system failure conditions
5. **Performance Validation** - E2E tests that validate conversion speed, memory usage, and concurrent processing capabilities

## Out of Scope

- Unit test expansion (already well covered)
- Visual regression testing setup (separate initiative)
- Load testing infrastructure (handled by benchmarks)
- Documentation updates (separate from testing implementation)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Achieve and maintain 90% overall E2E test coverage with automated monitoring and regression prevention
2. Complete test suite covering all critical user journeys from SVG input through PowerPoint output and preview generation
3. Robust error handling validation ensuring graceful degradation under all failure scenarios
