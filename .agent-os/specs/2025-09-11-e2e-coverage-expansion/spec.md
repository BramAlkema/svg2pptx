# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: E2E Coverage Expansion
> Created: 2025-09-11

## Overview

Expand end-to-end test coverage with real-world SVG files through comprehensive full workflow testing from file upload to PowerPoint download. This initiative will establish robust regression prevention by testing actual design tool outputs (Figma, Illustrator, Inkscape) through the complete conversion pipeline, ensuring production reliability and catching breaking changes before deployment.

## User Stories

### Real-World Design File Conversion

As a designer using Figma/Illustrator/Inkscape, I want to convert my exported SVG files to PowerPoint presentations through the web API, so that my vector graphics maintain fidelity and styling in business presentations.

The workflow involves uploading actual design tool SVG exports, processing them through the full conversion pipeline (SVG parsing → converter registry → DrawingML generation → PPTX creation), and downloading functional PowerPoint files that preserve the original design intent, colors, shapes, text, and layout.

### Regression Prevention for Production

As a developer maintaining the SVG2PPTX service, I want comprehensive E2E tests covering real-world scenarios, so that code changes don't break existing functionality for users' actual design files.

The testing system will maintain a library of representative SVG files from major design tools, run them through complete conversion workflows, and verify both technical correctness (valid PPTX generation) and visual fidelity (content preservation) to catch regressions before they reach production.

### Complete API Workflow Validation

As a user of the SVG2PPTX API, I want reliable file upload, conversion, and download processes, so that I can integrate the service into my applications with confidence.

The E2E tests will cover the full API lifecycle including multipart file uploads, conversion status tracking, error handling for invalid files, and successful PPTX download, ensuring all integration points work correctly under real-world conditions.

## Spec Scope

1. **Real-World SVG Test Library** - Curated collection of SVG files from Figma, Illustrator, Inkscape, and web exports covering diverse design patterns
2. **Full API Workflow Testing** - Complete end-to-end tests from file upload through conversion to PPTX download via FastAPI endpoints
3. **Visual Fidelity Validation** - Automated comparison systems to verify converted PowerPoint files maintain design integrity
4. **Converter Module Coverage** - Comprehensive testing ensuring all converter modules (shapes, paths, text, gradients, filters) are exercised by real scenarios
5. **Regression Test Suite** - Continuous integration framework to run real-world conversion tests on every code change

## Out of Scope

- Google Apps Script integration testing (focus on Python API only)
- Performance benchmarking and optimization
- User interface testing (API-focused testing only)
- Manual visual inspection workflows

## Expected Deliverable

1. E2E test suite successfully converts 50+ real-world SVG files from major design tools to valid PowerPoint presentations
2. Automated regression testing pipeline integrated with CI/CD that catches converter module failures before deployment
3. Test coverage reporting showing 80%+ coverage across all converter modules through real-world scenario execution
