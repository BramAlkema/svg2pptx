> Spec: SVG2PPTX Test Coverage Improvement
> Created: 2025-01-10
> Status: Planning

## Overview

This specification outlines a systematic approach to achieve comprehensive test coverage for low-coverage converter modules in the SVG2PPTX project. The goal is to bring all converter modules to 95%+ test coverage through targeted testing strategies that leverage the established lxml migration patterns and proven testing methodologies from successfully covered modules.

## User Stories

- **As a developer**, I want comprehensive test coverage for all converter modules so that I can confidently refactor and extend functionality without fear of breaking existing features
- **As a maintainer**, I want systematic test patterns that can be consistently applied across modules to ensure code quality and reliability
- **As a contributor**, I want clear testing guidelines and patterns to follow when adding new functionality to converter modules
- **As a project stakeholder**, I want confidence that the SVG2PPTX conversion engine handles edge cases and error conditions gracefully

## Spec Scope

### Target Modules (Priority Order)
1. **converters/masking.py** (0.0% → 95%+ coverage)
   - SVG mask element processing
   - Clipping path implementations
   - Opacity and visibility handling
   
2. **converters/text_path.py** (0.0% → 95%+ coverage)
   - Text along path functionality
   - Path following algorithms
   - Text positioning and orientation
   
3. **converters/gradients.py** (11.5% → 95%+ coverage)
   - Linear gradient processing
   - Radial gradient handling
   - Color stop management
   - Gradient transformations
   
4. **converters/styles.py** (13.5% → 95%+ coverage)
   - CSS style parsing and application
   - Inline style processing
   - Style inheritance patterns
   - Style conflict resolution
   
5. **converters/filters.py** (36.1% → 95%+ coverage)
   - SVG filter effect processing
   - Filter primitive implementations
   - Filter chaining and composition

### Technical Requirements

#### Core Testing Standards
- All tests must use **lxml** (not ElementTree) for XML processing
- Follow established patterns from `animations.py` (93.6%) and `markers.py` (98.2%) test suites
- Use proper parent-child XML relationships with `ET.SubElement()`
- Implement abstract methods for testability where needed
- Mock dependencies appropriately to isolate unit testing
- Include comprehensive error handling and edge case testing

#### Coverage Targets
- **Primary Goal**: 95%+ line coverage for each target module
- **Secondary Goal**: 90%+ branch coverage for complex conditional logic
- **Tertiary Goal**: Integration test coverage for module interactions

## Out of Scope

- Performance optimization testing (separate from coverage goals)
- Cross-platform compatibility testing beyond existing CI/CD
- Visual regression testing for PowerPoint output quality
- Memory usage and resource consumption testing
- Backward compatibility testing for older SVG specifications
- Third-party dependency vulnerability testing

## Expected Deliverable

A comprehensive test suite implementation that:

1. **Achieves 95%+ coverage** for all five target converter modules
2. **Establishes reusable patterns** for future converter module testing
3. **Provides clear documentation** of testing approaches and methodologies
4. **Integrates seamlessly** with existing CI/CD pipeline and coverage reporting
5. **Maintains high code quality** through consistent testing standards

### Success Metrics
- All target modules reach 95%+ test coverage
- Zero regression in existing module coverage
- All new tests pass consistently in CI/CD
- Test execution time remains under acceptable thresholds
- Code quality metrics (complexity, maintainability) improve or remain stable
