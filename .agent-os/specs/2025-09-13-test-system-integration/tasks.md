# Spec Tasks

## Tasks

- [ ] 1. Analyze and categorize existing test files
  - [ ] 1.1 Write automated analysis script to categorize root-level test files
  - [ ] 1.2 Scan all 26+ test files in /tests/ root and classify by type (unit/integration/e2e)
  - [ ] 1.3 Identify duplicate fixtures and scattered conftest.py files
  - [ ] 1.4 Generate migration plan with file mapping to target directories
  - [ ] 1.5 Verify analysis results against current test structure

- [ ] 2. Migrate converter test files to organized structure
  - [ ] 2.1 Write tests for migration validation and rollback mechanisms
  - [ ] 2.2 Move converter tests from /tests/ root to /tests/unit/converters/
  - [ ] 2.3 Update import statements to use centralized fixtures from tests.fixtures
  - [ ] 2.4 Apply proper pytest markers (unit, converter) to migrated tests
  - [ ] 2.5 Remove duplicate fixture definitions and update to centralized system
  - [ ] 2.6 Verify all migrated converter tests pass with new structure

- [ ] 3. Migrate utility and integration test files
  - [ ] 3.1 Write validation tests for utility module migration
  - [ ] 3.2 Move utility tests (colors, units, transforms) to /tests/unit/utils/
  - [ ] 3.3 Migrate integration tests to /tests/integration/ with proper categorization
  - [ ] 3.4 Update all imports to use centralized fixture system
  - [ ] 3.5 Apply appropriate pytest markers based on test content
  - [ ] 3.6 Verify all utility and integration tests pass

- [ ] 4. Clean up legacy test infrastructure
  - [ ] 4.1 Write cleanup validation to ensure no functionality is lost
  - [ ] 4.2 Remove scattered conftest.py files and duplicate fixture definitions
  - [ ] 4.3 Delete obsolete test utilities and unused mock objects
  - [ ] 4.4 Consolidate remaining test configuration into centralized system
  - [ ] 4.5 Update pytest configuration to optimize fixture loading
  - [ ] 4.6 Verify test suite runs cleanly with no legacy remnants

- [ ] 5. Enhance test coverage for critical modules
  - [ ] 5.1 Write comprehensive coverage enhancement tests for shapes converter
  - [ ] 5.2 Implement missing unit tests for text converter edge cases
  - [ ] 5.3 Add integration tests for gradient and filter processing
  - [ ] 5.4 Create performance benchmark tests for critical conversion paths
  - [ ] 5.5 Implement error handling and malformed input tests
  - [ ] 5.6 Verify coverage targets: 50% overall, 60%+ for critical converters
  - [ ] 5.7 Generate comprehensive coverage report and validate improvements
