> Spec: Test System Integration and Legacy Cleanup
> Created: 2025-09-13

## Overview

Complete the test system integration by migrating all existing tests to the new centralized fixture system and removing legacy testing remnants to establish a unified, modern testing infrastructure. This consolidation will improve test maintainability, increase coverage from 9.67% to 50%, and eliminate scattered test files and duplicate infrastructure.

## User Stories

### Test Developer Experience Enhancement

As a developer, I want all tests to use a consistent, centralized fixture system, so that I can write tests efficiently without duplicating setup code or searching for scattered fixtures across multiple conftest.py files.

When a developer needs to write a new converter test, they import from `tests.fixtures` and immediately have access to properly configured mock contexts, sample SVG content, and standardized test utilities. The developer knows exactly where to place the test file based on the clear directory structure and can rely on consistent behavior across all test categories.

### Test Infrastructure Maintenance

As a maintainer, I want all legacy test remnants removed and tests properly organized, so that the codebase has a clean, scalable testing architecture that supports continuous improvement.

The maintainer can easily identify test coverage gaps through organized test structure, run specific test categories using markers, and confidently add new test infrastructure knowing it follows established patterns. Legacy scattered files are eliminated, reducing confusion and maintenance overhead.

### Quality Assurance Coverage

As a QA engineer, I want comprehensive test coverage for critical SVG conversion functions, so that regressions are caught early and the conversion quality remains high.

Critical converter modules (paths, shapes, text) achieve 60%+ coverage with robust edge case testing, error handling validation, and integration scenarios. The QA engineer can run targeted test suites for specific conversion features and trust that the coverage metrics accurately reflect test completeness.

## Spec Scope

1. **Test Migration** - Move all 26+ root-level test files to proper directory structure (unit/, integration/, e2e/)
2. **Fixture Consolidation** - Eliminate duplicate fixtures and standardize all tests to use centralized fixture system
3. **Legacy Cleanup** - Remove scattered conftest.py files, unused test utilities, and obsolete test infrastructure
4. **Coverage Enhancement** - Improve critical converter modules to 60%+ coverage and overall project to 50%
5. **Test Organization** - Ensure proper test categorization with consistent marker usage and directory placement

## Out of Scope

- Archive test files (keep existing archive/ directory as historical reference)
- Complete rewrite of working tests (focus on migration and enhancement, not replacement)
- Immediate achievement of 85% coverage target (set as long-term goal, not immediate requirement)
- E2E test framework changes (maintain existing Playwright and API testing setup)

## Expected Deliverable

1. All root-level test files properly categorized and moved to appropriate subdirectories with updated imports
2. Single centralized fixture system eliminates all duplicate test setup code across the project
3. Test coverage metrics show 50%+ overall coverage with critical converter modules achieving 60%+ coverage
4. Clean test directory structure with no scattered conftest.py files or legacy test remnants
5. Comprehensive test run passes with improved performance due to optimized fixture loading and test organization
