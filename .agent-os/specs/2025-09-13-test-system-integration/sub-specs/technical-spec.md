# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-13-test-system-integration/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

- **Test File Migration**: Systematically move 26+ root-level test files to proper directory structure using automated analysis and validation
- **Fixture System Integration**: Update all test imports to use centralized fixtures from `tests.fixtures` module with proper dependency injection
- **Legacy Infrastructure Removal**: Identify and remove duplicate conftest.py files, scattered mock objects, and obsolete test utilities
- **Coverage Analysis Integration**: Implement coverage tracking with HTML/XML reporting and per-module coverage validation
- **Test Categorization**: Apply proper pytest markers (unit, integration, e2e, benchmark) based on test content analysis
- **Import Path Standardization**: Update all test imports to use absolute paths and centralized fixture system
- **Performance Optimization**: Consolidate fixture loading to reduce test execution time and eliminate redundant setup
- **Directory Structure Enforcement**: Ensure all tests follow the established `/tests/{category}/{module}/` structure
- **Validation Framework**: Create automated checks to verify proper test organization and fixture usage
- **Coverage Threshold Management**: Configure per-module coverage targets with incremental improvement tracking
