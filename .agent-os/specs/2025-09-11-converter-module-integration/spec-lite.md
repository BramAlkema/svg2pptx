# Converter Module Integration - Lite Summary

Integrate existing well-tested converter modules (~40% unit test coverage) with the main E2E conversion pipeline to bridge the gap between modular converter architecture and end-to-end conversion system. This will eliminate the current 0% converter coverage in E2E reports while ensuring the modular architecture is actually used in production.

## Key Points
- Bridge existing converter modules with E2E pipeline through proper integration layer
- Unify test coverage reporting to show converter module coverage in E2E metrics
- Implement consistent error handling and propagation across the entire conversion flow
