# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Converter Module Integration
> Created: 2025-09-11
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Integrate the existing well-tested converter modules (~40% unit test coverage) with the main E2E conversion pipeline, which currently shows 0% coverage for converters. This will bridge the gap between the modular converter architecture and the end-to-end conversion system.

## User Stories

### Story 1: E2E Pipeline Uses Converter Modules
As a developer running the E2E conversion pipeline, I want the system to use the existing converter modules instead of bypassing them, so that I benefit from their tested functionality and reliability.

**Workflow:**
1. User initiates E2E conversion process
2. Pipeline detects required conversion type
3. System routes to appropriate converter module
4. Converter module processes content using tested logic
5. Result is returned to E2E pipeline for further processing

### Story 2: Unified Test Coverage Reporting
As a developer reviewing test coverage, I want to see the converter module test coverage reflected in the E2E pipeline coverage metrics, so that I have accurate visibility into the overall system test coverage.

**Workflow:**
1. Developer runs test coverage analysis
2. System includes converter module coverage in E2E metrics
3. Coverage report shows integrated results
4. Developer can identify gaps in overall conversion coverage

### Story 3: Consistent Error Handling
As a developer debugging conversion failures, I want consistent error handling between converter modules and the E2E pipeline, so that I can efficiently troubleshoot issues across the entire conversion flow.

**Workflow:**
1. Conversion error occurs in converter module
2. Error is properly propagated through integration layer
3. E2E pipeline receives structured error information
4. Developer can trace error from E2E context back to specific converter

## Spec Scope

1. **Module Integration Layer**: Create an integration layer that connects E2E pipeline to converter modules with proper dependency injection and error handling
2. **Pipeline Routing Logic**: Implement routing logic in E2E pipeline to direct conversion requests to appropriate converter modules based on content type and conversion requirements
3. **Test Coverage Integration**: Merge converter module test results with E2E pipeline coverage reporting to provide unified coverage metrics
4. **Error Propagation System**: Establish consistent error handling and propagation between converter modules and E2E pipeline
5. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure integration doesn't introduce performance regressions while maintaining the benefits of modular architecture

## Out of Scope

- Rewriting existing converter module functionality
- Adding new converter types or capabilities
- Changing the E2E pipeline's external API
- Performance optimizations beyond maintaining current benchmarks
- Adding new test frameworks or testing approaches

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Integration**: E2E conversion pipeline successfully utilizes converter modules for all supported conversion types with zero regression in conversion accuracy
2. **Unified Test Coverage**: Combined test coverage reporting shows converter module coverage integrated with E2E pipeline metrics, eliminating the current 0% converter coverage in E2E reports
3. **Error Traceability**: Consistent error handling system that provides clear error propagation from converter modules through E2E pipeline with structured error messages for debugging
