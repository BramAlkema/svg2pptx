> Spec: Testing Infrastructure Consolidation
> Created: 2025-09-12
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Consolidate and systematically organize the SVG2PPTX testing infrastructure to establish consistent naming conventions and a clear hierarchy from foundational unit tests through end-to-end testing branches.

## User Stories

**Story 1: Developer Test Organization**
As a developer working on SVG2PPTX, I want a clearly organized testing structure so I can quickly locate relevant tests and understand the testing hierarchy from unit to integration to E2E levels.

**Story 2: Test Naming Consistency**
As a team member reviewing test files, I want consistent naming conventions across all test types so I can immediately understand what each test covers and how tests relate to each other.

**Story 3: Systematic Test Coverage**
As a maintainer of the codebase, I want a systematic approach to testing that ensures all functionality is covered through logical test progression from foundational components to complete workflows.

## Spec Scope

1. **Establish foundational testing structure** - Create clear hierarchy starting from unit tests for core components
2. **Implement consistent naming conventions** - Apply standardized naming patterns across all test files and directories
3. **Organize existing test files** - Systematically review and reorganize current testing infrastructure
4. **Create E2E testing branches** - Structure end-to-end tests to build upon foundational unit tests
5. **Document testing methodology** - Establish clear guidelines for future test creation and organization

## Out of Scope

- Test coverage percentage targets or metrics
- Performance benchmarking of test execution
- Implementation of new testing frameworks or tools
- Refactoring of existing test logic or assertions
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline modifications

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Organized test directory structure** with clear hierarchy from unit to E2E tests following consistent naming conventions
2. **Consolidated test infrastructure** where all existing tests are systematically categorized and properly organized
3. **Testing methodology documentation** that provides clear guidelines for maintaining the organized structure and naming consistency
