# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-09-unit-testing-system/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Unit Testing Framework
- **Pytest Configuration**: Advanced pytest.ini with custom markers, fixtures paths, and coverage settings
- **Test Structure**: Organized test directories mirroring source code structure (tests/unit/, tests/integration/, tests/visual/)
- **Fixture Management**: Centralized fixtures in conftest.py files with scope management (function, class, module, session)
- **Mock Strategy**: Comprehensive mocking of external dependencies using pytest-mock and unittest.mock
- **Parameterized Testing**: Data-driven tests using pytest.mark.parametrize for edge cases and boundary testing

### Visual Regression Testing
- **Image Generation**: Convert PPTX slides to PNG using python-pptx and Pillow for pixel comparison
- **Diff Algorithm**: Implement perceptual diff using SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) with configurable thresholds
- **Baseline Management**: Git-tracked baseline images with automatic update workflows
- **Report Generation**: HTML reports with side-by-side comparisons and diff overlays
- **Performance**: Parallel image processing using multiprocessing for large test suites

### Performance Benchmarking
- **Metrics Collection**: Track execution time, memory usage, and resource consumption per test
- **Benchmark Storage**: SQLite database for historical performance data and trend analysis
- **Regression Detection**: Statistical analysis to identify performance regressions (>10% degradation)
- **Integration**: pytest-benchmark plugin with custom fixtures for converter operations
- **Reporting**: Performance trend graphs and regression alerts in CI/CD

### Test Generation
- **Property-Based Testing**: Hypothesis framework for generating test inputs based on specifications
- **Fixture Generation**: Automated fixture creation from SVG samples and converter outputs
- **Test Templates**: Code generation for common test patterns (converter tests, utility tests)
- **Coverage Gap Analysis**: Identify untested code paths and suggest test cases
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated test documentation from docstrings and assertions

### Coverage Reporting
- **Coverage Tools**: pytest-cov with branch coverage and context tracking
- **Threshold Enforcement**: Fail builds if coverage drops below 80% (configurable per module)
- **Report Formats**: HTML, XML (for CI/CD), and terminal output with detailed line coverage
- **Exclusion Patterns**: Proper handling of unreachable code and external interfaces
- **Integration**: Coverage badges and trend tracking in repository

### CI/CD Integration
- **GitHub Actions**: Workflow files for test execution on push and pull requests
- **Test Parallelization**: pytest-xdist for distributed test execution across multiple cores
- **Artifact Management**: Store test reports, coverage data, and visual regression results
- **Notification System**: Slack/email notifications for test failures and coverage drops
- **Performance Gates**: Block merges if performance benchmarks regress significantly

## External Dependencies

- **pytest-cov** (≥4.0.0) - Coverage plugin for pytest with branch coverage support
- **pytest-mock** (≥3.10.0) - Thin wrapper around unittest.mock for pytest
- **pytest-benchmark** (≥4.0.0) - Performance regression testing framework
- **pytest-xdist** (≥3.0.0) - Distributed testing plugin for parallel execution
- **hypothesis** (≥6.80.0) - Property-based testing for automatic test case generation
- **Pillow** (≥10.0.0) - Image processing for visual regression testing
- **scikit-image** (≥0.21.0) - SSIM algorithm for perceptual image comparison
- **coverage** (≥7.0.0) - Code coverage measurement tool
- **pytest-html** (≥3.2.0) - HTML report generation for test results

**Justification:** These dependencies are industry-standard testing tools that provide essential functionality for comprehensive testing. They integrate well with pytest and are actively maintained with strong community support.
