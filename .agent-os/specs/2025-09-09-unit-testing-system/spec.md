> Spec: Extensive Unit Testing System
> Created: 2025-09-09

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive unit testing system for the SVG2PPTX converter that provides full test coverage for all converter modules, utilities, and performance optimizations. This system will ensure code reliability, catch regressions early, and provide confidence for continuous development through automated testing, visual regression testing, and performance benchmarking.

## User Stories

### Developer Testing Workflow

As a developer, I want to run comprehensive unit tests for any module I modify, so that I can ensure my changes don't break existing functionality.

The developer makes changes to a converter module, runs `pytest tests/unit/converters/test_shapes.py` and immediately sees detailed test results including coverage metrics, performance benchmarks, and any visual regression differences. The system automatically generates test cases for new methods and provides fixtures for common test scenarios.

### CI/CD Integration

As a DevOps engineer, I want automated test execution in the CI/CD pipeline, so that no code reaches production without passing all quality gates.

When code is pushed to the repository, the CI/CD pipeline automatically runs the full test suite, checks coverage thresholds (minimum 80%), executes performance benchmarks, and generates visual regression reports. Failed tests block deployment and provide detailed failure analysis.

### Visual Regression Testing

As a QA engineer, I want to verify that SVG-to-PPTX conversions produce visually correct output, so that we maintain conversion quality across updates.

The testing system converts reference SVG files to PPTX, extracts slides as images, and compares them against baseline images using perceptual diff algorithms. Any visual differences above the threshold trigger test failures with side-by-side comparison reports.

## Spec Scope

1. **Unit Test Framework** - Comprehensive pytest-based testing with fixtures, mocks, and parameterized tests for all modules
2. **Visual Regression Testing** - Image comparison system for validating conversion output quality
3. **Performance Benchmarking** - Test-integrated performance metrics with regression detection
4. **Test Generation** - Automated test case generation for common patterns and property-based testing
5. **Coverage Reporting** - Code coverage analysis with enforced thresholds and detailed reports

## Out of Scope

- End-to-end integration testing with external services (Google Drive, Google Slides)
- Load testing and stress testing infrastructure
- Security testing and penetration testing
- Browser-based UI testing for web interfaces

## Expected Deliverable

1. Complete pytest test suite with 80%+ code coverage for all converter modules and utilities
2. Visual regression testing system that can detect conversion quality issues automatically
3. CI/CD-integrated test execution with coverage gates and automated reporting
