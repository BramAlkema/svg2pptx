> Spec: Advanced SVG Features with OOXML Precision
> Created: 2025-09-14

## Overview

Implement high-priority advanced SVG features by leveraging PowerPoint's hidden OOXML precision capabilities, including subpixel Bezier curves, per-mille gradient positioning, advanced filter effect chaining, and pattern fills. This enhancement will significantly improve SVG conversion fidelity while maintaining PowerPoint compatibility and performance.

## User Stories

### Professional Designer Workflow

As a professional designer, I want to convert complex SVG graphics with advanced filter effects and pattern fills to PowerPoint, so that my presentations maintain the visual sophistication of the original designs without degradation.

The designer workflow involves creating complex graphics in tools like Adobe Illustrator or Figma with layered effects, custom patterns, mesh gradients, and precise text-on-path layouts. When converting to PowerPoint via SVG2PPTX, these advanced features should be preserved using PowerPoint's native OOXML precision capabilities rather than being simplified or lost.

### Technical Precision Requirement

As a technical illustrator, I want SVG graphics with precise geometric relationships and subpixel accuracy to convert with mathematical precision to PowerPoint, so that technical diagrams maintain their accuracy for engineering presentations.

This involves converting CAD-like SVG diagrams where millimeter-level precision matters, complex Bezier curves define exact shapes, and gradient color stops must be positioned with scientific accuracy. PowerPoint's EMU precision system (914,400 units per inch) should enable this level of fidelity.

### Creative Effects Workflow

As a creative professional, I want advanced SVG filter effects and mesh gradients to render beautifully in PowerPoint, so that artistic presentations retain their visual impact without requiring manual recreation.

Complex artistic SVGs often use filter effect chains (blur + shadow + color adjustments), mesh gradients for realistic lighting, and intricate pattern fills. These should convert using PowerPoint's advanced OOXML effects rather than being flattened to basic shapes.

## Spec Scope

1. **Subpixel Precision System** - Implement fractional EMU coordinates for subpixel-accurate Bezier curves and positioning
2. **Advanced Gradient Engine** - Add mesh gradient support using overlapping shapes and per-mille precision gradient stops
3. **Filter Effects Pipeline** - Implement comprehensive filter effect chaining using PowerPoint's native image effects
4. **Pattern Fill System** - Create advanced pattern fills with transforms and nested pattern support
5. **Text-on-Path Enhancement** - Implement precise text following complex paths using PowerPoint's text effects

## Out of Scope

- SVG animation features (covered by existing animation system)
- ICC color profile management (beyond PowerPoint's capabilities)
- Server-side rendering optimizations (focus on conversion quality)
- Backward compatibility with pre-2016 PowerPoint versions

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Advanced filter effects render correctly** - Complex SVG filter chains convert to visually equivalent PowerPoint effects
2. **Pattern fills display accurately** - Custom SVG patterns convert to PowerPoint texture fills with proper scaling and transforms
3. **Subpixel precision maintained** - Technical diagrams convert with mathematical accuracy using EMU precision system
