# Batch Processing API - Lite Summary

Implement comprehensive batch processing API endpoints that allow users to convert multiple SVG files to PowerPoint format in a single operation, building on the existing batch processing infrastructure. This feature provides RESTful endpoints for ZIP/multi-file uploads, asynchronous job tracking with progress reporting, configurable output formats (single PPTX vs individual files), and comprehensive testing coverage including performance benchmarks and error scenario validation.

## Key Points
- RESTful endpoints for ZIP/multi-file uploads with asynchronous processing
- Job tracking system with real-time progress reporting and status updates
- Configurable output formats supporting both single PPTX and individual file generation
