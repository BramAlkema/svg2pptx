# Testing Strategy

This is the comprehensive testing strategy for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-11-batch-processing-api/spec.md

## Testing Overview

The testing strategy encompasses unit tests, integration tests, performance benchmarks, and error scenario validation to ensure robust batch processing functionality with >95% code coverage and reliable production deployment.

## Unit Testing

### Batch Processing Core Logic
- **BatchProcessor Class Tests**: Validate job creation, status tracking, and progress calculation
- **File Validation Tests**: Test SVG file format validation, ZIP archive processing, and file size limits
- **Configuration Tests**: Verify batch size limits, worker configuration, and timeout settings
- **Error Handling Tests**: Test exception handling, partial failure recovery, and cleanup operations

### Test Files Location
```
tests/unit/batch/
├── test_batch_processor.py      # Core batch processing logic
├── test_file_validation.py      # Input validation and file handling
├── test_job_management.py       # Job creation and tracking
└── test_error_scenarios.py      # Error handling and recovery
```

### Coverage Targets
- **BatchProcessor**: 100% line coverage
- **File validation**: 95% line coverage  
- **Error handling**: 90% branch coverage
- **Configuration management**: 95% line coverage

## Integration Testing

### API Endpoint Testing
- **POST /batch/convert-zip**: Test ZIP upload with various file combinations (1-20 SVG files)
- **POST /batch/convert-files**: Test multiple file uploads with different file sizes and formats
- **GET /batch/status/{batch_id}**: Validate status reporting throughout job lifecycle
- **GET /batch/download/{batch_id}**: Test file download for both output formats

### End-to-End Workflows
- **Complete Batch Conversion**: Upload → Processing → Status Tracking → Download → Cleanup
- **Partial Failure Scenarios**: Mixed valid/invalid files with proper error reporting
- **Concurrent Batch Processing**: Multiple simultaneous batches with resource management
- **Large File Processing**: Test with maximum file sizes and batch limits

### Test Files Location

├── test_batch_api_endpoints.py   # REST API integration tests
├── test_batch_workflows.py       # End-to-end workflow testing
├── test_concurrent_processing.py # Multiple batch job handling
└── test_file_processing.py       # Large file and edge case testing
```

### Test Data Requirements
```
tests/data/batch/
├── valid_svgs/                   # 1-20 valid SVG files of varying complexity
├── invalid_files/                # Non-SVG files for validation testing
├── large_files/                  # Files near size limits (9-11MB)
├── test_archives/                # Pre-built ZIP files for upload testing
└── corrupted_data/               # Malformed SVG and ZIP files
```

## Performance Testing

### Benchmarking Scenarios
- **Small Batches**: 1-5 files, measure response time and throughput
- **Medium Batches**: 10-15 files, validate concurrent processing efficiency
- **Large Batches**: 20 files at maximum size, test resource utilization
- **Concurrent Load**: Multiple simultaneous batches, measure system scalability

### Performance Metrics
- **API Response Time**: Initial job creation <500ms
- **Processing Throughput**: Complete small batch (5 files) within 2 minutes
- **Memory Usage**: Peak memory consumption during large batch processing
- **Resource Cleanup**: Verify temporary file cleanup within 30 seconds

### Test Implementation
```python
# tests/performance/test_batch_performance.py
class TestBatchPerformance:
    def test_small_batch_response_time(self):
        # Measure API response for 1-5 file batches
        
    def test_concurrent_batch_processing(self):
        # Test 3-5 simultaneous batches
        
    def test_large_batch_resource_usage(self):
        # Monitor memory and CPU during max size batch
        
    def test_cleanup_performance(self):
        # Verify efficient temporary file cleanup
```

## Error Scenario Testing

### Input Validation Errors
- **Invalid File Formats**: Upload non-SVG files and verify proper rejection
- **Size Limit Violations**: Test files exceeding individual (10MB) and batch (100MB) limits
- **Malformed ZIP Archives**: Corrupted ZIP files and archives with no SVG content
- **Parameter Validation**: Invalid output_format, slide dimensions, and missing required fields

### Processing Errors
- **Individual File Failures**: SVG files with parse errors or unsupported features
- **Timeout Scenarios**: Files requiring excessive processing time (>30s)
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Batches exceeding available system resources
- **Concurrent Limit Violations**: Attempts to exceed maximum concurrent batch limits

### System Errors
- **Network Interruptions**: Partial uploads and connection failures
- **Storage Issues**: Disk space exhaustion during processing
- **Service Unavailability**: Downstream service failures and recovery
- **Cleanup Failures**: Scenarios where temporary file cleanup encounters errors

### Test Implementation
```python
# tests/error_scenarios/test_batch_error_handling.py
class TestBatchErrorHandling:
    def test_invalid_file_rejection(self):
        # Verify proper handling of non-SVG files
        
    def test_partial_batch_failure(self):
        # Mixed valid/invalid files with error reporting
        
    def test_resource_limit_enforcement(self):
        # Size and count limit validation
        
    def test_graceful_degradation(self):
        # System behavior under resource constraints
```

## Test Automation and CI/CD Integration

### Automated Test Execution
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Run unit tests and basic integration tests before code commits
- **CI Pipeline**: Execute full test suite on pull requests and main branch pushes
- **Nightly Builds**: Run performance tests and comprehensive error scenario testing
- **Release Testing**: Complete test suite execution with extended timeout scenarios

### Test Reporting and Coverage
- **Coverage Reports**: Generate detailed coverage reports with branch and line coverage metrics
- **Performance Baselines**: Track performance metrics over time with regression detection
- **Error Rate Monitoring**: Monitor test failure rates and success metrics
- **Test Result Notifications**: Automated alerts for test failures and coverage drops
