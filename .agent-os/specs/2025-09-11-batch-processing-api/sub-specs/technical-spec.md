# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-11-batch-processing-api/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Core API Infrastructure
- **FastAPI Integration**: Extend existing `api/main.py` with new batch processing routes using existing authentication and middleware patterns
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Implement background task processing using FastAPI's BackgroundTasks or Celery integration for job queue management
- **File Handling**: Leverage existing temporary file management in `api/services/conversion_service.py` with enhanced cleanup for batch operations
- **Batch Processing Engine**: Build upon existing `src/performance/batch.py` infrastructure with `BatchProcessor` class and configurable worker management

### Performance and Scalability
- **Concurrent Processing**: Utilize existing `max_batch_workers: 4` configuration with ability to scale based on system resources
- **Memory Management**: Implement streaming file processing to handle large ZIP uploads without excessive memory consumption
- **Resource Limits**: Enforce maximum batch size of 20 files initially, with configurable limits via environment variables
- **Progress Tracking**: Implement efficient job status storage using in-memory cache (Redis optional) with periodic persistence

### Error Handling and Resilience
- **Partial Failure Recovery**: Design system to continue processing remaining files when individual conversions fail
- **Detailed Error Reporting**: Provide per-file error messages with conversion failure reasons and suggested remediation
- **Timeout Management**: Implement reasonable timeouts for individual file conversions (30s) and overall batch processing (10 minutes)
- **Cleanup on Failure**: Ensure temporary files are properly cleaned up even when batch processing encounters errors

### Security and Validation
- **File Type Validation**: Extend existing SVG validation to batch uploads with MIME type checking and file signature verification
- **Size Limits**: Implement per-file (10MB) and total batch size (100MB) limits with clear error messages
- **Rate Limiting**: Apply existing rate limiting patterns to batch endpoints to prevent abuse
- **Input Sanitization**: Validate ZIP file contents and reject malicious or corrupted archives

### Integration Points
- **Google Drive Integration**: Leverage existing OAuth and Drive API integration for directory processing capabilities
- **Existing Converter System**: Utilize modular converter architecture under `src/converters/` without modifications
- **Configuration Management**: Extend existing configuration system to support batch-specific settings
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Integrate with existing logging infrastructure for batch operation tracking and debugging

## External Dependencies

**uuid4** - Standard library UUID generation for batch job IDs
- **Justification:** Required for unique batch job identification and tracking across API requests

**zipfile** - Standard library ZIP archive handling  
- **Justification:** Essential for processing uploaded ZIP files containing multiple SVG inputs

**asyncio** - Standard library asynchronous processing
- **Justification:** Required for background batch processing without blocking API responses

**redis (Optional)** - In-memory data structure store
- **Justification:** Optional dependency for enhanced job status persistence and scalability in production deployments
