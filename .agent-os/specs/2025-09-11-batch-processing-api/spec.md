> Spec: Batch Processing API
> Created: 2025-09-11

## Overview

Implement comprehensive batch processing API endpoints that allow users to convert multiple SVG files to PowerPoint format in a single operation, building on the existing batch processing infrastructure. This feature will significantly improve user efficiency for bulk conversions while providing robust progress tracking, error handling, and testing coverage.

## User Stories

### Bulk SVG Conversion for Presentation Creation

As a presentation designer, I want to upload multiple SVG files at once and receive a single PowerPoint presentation with each SVG as a separate slide, so that I can efficiently create presentations from my vector graphics library without manual one-by-one conversion.

The user uploads a ZIP file containing 10-20 SVG files through the web interface, receives a batch job ID, can track conversion progress in real-time, and downloads a complete PPTX file with properly formatted slides. Error handling ensures partial failures are reported clearly while successful conversions are preserved.

### Enterprise Batch Processing with Directory Integration

As a content manager, I want to process entire directories of SVG files from cloud storage and receive individual PPTX files for each source SVG, so that I can maintain organized file structures while leveraging bulk conversion efficiency.

The user selects a Google Drive folder containing SVG files, configures output preferences (single PPTX vs individual files), initiates batch processing, monitors progress via status API, and receives a ZIP archive of converted files with preserved naming conventions and proper error reporting.

### API Integration for Workflow Automation

As a developer, I want to integrate batch SVG conversion into automated workflows with comprehensive testing coverage, so that I can build reliable systems that handle bulk conversions with proper error handling and performance monitoring.

The developer uses REST API endpoints to submit batch jobs programmatically, receives structured responses with job tracking capabilities, implements error handling for partial failures, and relies on comprehensive test coverage to ensure system reliability in production environments.

## Spec Scope

1. **Batch Upload Endpoints** - RESTful API endpoints supporting ZIP file uploads and multiple individual file submissions with proper validation and size limits.

2. **Job Tracking System** - Asynchronous job processing with unique batch IDs, real-time status reporting, and progress percentage tracking.

3. **Multiple Output Formats** - User-configurable output as either single PPTX with multiple slides or ZIP archive containing individual PPTX files.

4. **Enhanced Error Handling** - Comprehensive error reporting for partial batch failures with detailed per-file status and fallback processing.

5. **Comprehensive Testing Suite** - Full test coverage including unit tests, API integration tests, performance benchmarks, and error scenario validation.

## Out of Scope

- Google Apps Script integration (reserved for Phase 2)
- Real-time WebSocket progress updates (polling-based status checking sufficient)
- Advanced batch scheduling or queue management systems
- Integration with external cloud storage providers beyond Google Drive
- Complex batch job dependency management or workflow orchestration

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional API Endpoints** - POST `/batch/convert-zip` and `/batch/convert-files` endpoints accepting file uploads and returning batch job IDs with proper HTTP status codes.

2. **Job Status Tracking** - GET `/batch/status/{batch_id}` endpoint providing real-time progress updates, completion status, and detailed error reporting accessible via browser testing.

3. **Complete Test Coverage** - Comprehensive test suite achieving >95% code coverage including unit tests, integration tests, performance benchmarks, and error scenario validation with automated CI/CD integration.
