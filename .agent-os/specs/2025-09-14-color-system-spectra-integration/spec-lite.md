# Color System Spectra Integration - Lite Summary

Enhance the existing colors.py system with advanced color science algorithms inspired by spectra library's MIT-licensed implementation, providing perceptually uniform color interpolation and advanced color space conversions without external dependencies. This addresses the architectural issue where external color libraries were being imported directly in converters, implementing LAB/LCH color space mathematics natively for consistent, high-quality color handling across all converters.

## Key Points
- Implement color science algorithms natively in colors.py instead of external dependencies
- Establish perceptually uniform color interpolation using LAB/LCH color space mathematics
- Remove external library imports from individual converters for architectural consistency
