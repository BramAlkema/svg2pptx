> Spec: Advanced Color Science Enhancement
> Created: 2025-09-14
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Enhance the existing colors.py system with advanced color science algorithms inspired by spectra library's MIT-licensed implementation, providing perceptually uniform color interpolation and advanced color space conversions without external dependencies, while removing incorrect color handling from individual converters.

## User Stories

### Enhanced Color Accuracy
As a developer using SVG2PPTX, I want advanced color interpolation to be handled consistently across all converters, so that gradient processing, color blending, and color space conversions maintain high fidelity throughout the conversion pipeline.

The current scattered implementation of spectra across converters creates inconsistent color handling and violates the established architecture where colors.py serves as the universal color utility.

### Simplified Converter Logic
As a converter developer, I want to access advanced color interpolation through the standardized color system API, so that I can focus on element-specific conversion logic without managing color science dependencies directly.

This enables converters to leverage sophisticated color operations through clean, well-documented interfaces rather than managing spectra imports and error handling independently.

## Spec Scope

1. **Advanced Color Science Implementation** - Implement LAB/LCH color space conversion algorithms directly in colors.py inspired by spectra's MIT-licensed approach
2. **Perceptual Color Interpolation** - Add perceptually uniform color blending using LCH color space mathematics without external dependencies
3. **Gradient Converter Refactoring** - Remove spectra usage from gradients.py and utilize the enhanced centralized color system APIs
4. **Color Space Conversions** - Implement RGB↔XYZ↔LAB↔LCH conversion matrices and formulas for advanced color manipulation
5. **Batch Color Processing** - Add efficient batch color interpolation methods for complex gradient operations

## Out of Scope

- Creating new color parsing formats beyond existing CSS support
- Modifying the core ColorInfo dataclass structure to maintain API compatibility
- Adding external dependencies (implement color science algorithms directly)
- Performance optimizations beyond basic caching (handled separately)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Enhanced colors.py with native color science algorithms and comprehensive color interpolation API
2. Refactored gradients.py that uses centralized color system instead of external library imports
3. Comprehensive test coverage demonstrating improved color accuracy and consistent behavior across converters
