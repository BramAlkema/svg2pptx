These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-14-filters-refactoring/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-14
> Status: Ready for Implementation

## Tasks

### 1. Core Infrastructure Setup

**Goal**: Establish the foundational architecture, interfaces, and testing framework for the modular filter system.

1.1. Create package structure with proper __init__.py files for filters/, core/, image/, geometric/, utils/, and compatibility/ directories
1.2. Write comprehensive unit tests for abstract Filter base class covering apply() method signature, parameter validation, and error handling
1.3. Implement abstract Filter base class with standardized apply() method, type hints, and custom exception hierarchy
1.4. Write unit tests for FilterRegistry covering filter registration, discovery, instantiation, and error scenarios
1.5. Implement FilterRegistry class with dynamic filter discovery and thread-safe registration mechanisms
1.6. Write unit tests for FilterChain covering filter composition, execution order, and error propagation
1.7. Implement FilterChain class with pipeline pattern, lazy evaluation, and memory-efficient streaming
1.8. Verify all core infrastructure tests pass and achieve 100% code coverage on critical paths

### 2. Filter Primitives Refactoring

**Goal**: Extract and modularize basic filter operations from the monolithic filters.py file with comprehensive test coverage.

2.1. Write unit tests for blur filter implementations covering Gaussian blur, motion blur, and edge cases with various parameter combinations
2.2. Extract and refactor blur filter classes (Gaussian blur, motion blur) from filters.py into filters/image/blur.py with proper inheritance from Filter base class
2.3. Write unit tests for color filter implementations covering color matrix operations, flood effects, and lighting transformations
2.4. Extract and refactor color filter classes from filters.py into filters/image/color.py with NumPy optimization and parameter validation
2.5. Write unit tests for distortion filter implementations covering displacement maps, morphology operations, and boundary condition handling
2.6. Extract and refactor distortion filter classes from filters.py into filters/image/distortion.py with memory-efficient processing
2.7. Register all extracted image filters with FilterRegistry and write integration tests for filter discovery
2.8. Verify all filter primitive tests pass with minimum 90% code coverage and performance matches original implementation

### 3. Processing Engine Refactoring

**Goal**: Refactor geometric transformations and composite operations with proper separation of concerns and optimized performance.

- [x] 3.1. Write unit tests for geometric transform filters covering offset operations, turbulence generation, and mathematical edge cases
- [x] 3.2. Extract and refactor geometric transformation filters from filters.py into filters/geometric/transforms.py with proper vectorization
- [x] 3.3. Write unit tests for composite operations covering merge operations, blend modes, and multi-layer processing scenarios
- [x] 3.4. Extract and refactor composite filter classes from filters.py into filters/geometric/composite.py with memory optimization
- [x] 3.5. Write unit tests for parsing utilities covering SVG filter parsing, parameter extraction, and malformed input handling
- [x] 3.6. Implement parsing utilities in filters/utils/parsing.py with robust error handling and validation
- [x] 3.7. Write unit tests for mathematical helper functions covering all computational operations used by filters
- [x] 3.8. Implement mathematical helpers in filters/utils/math_helpers.py with NumPy optimization and verify all processing engine tests pass

### 4. Advanced Features Migration

**Goal**: Migrate complex filter combinations, configuration management, and performance optimizations while maintaining backward compatibility.

4.1. Write unit tests for validation utilities covering input sanitization, parameter bounds checking, and security validation
4.2. Implement validation utilities in filters/utils/validation.py with comprehensive security checks and performance optimization
4.3. Write unit tests for configuration management covering hierarchy resolution, environment variable handling, and performance profiles
4.4. Implement configuration system with dataclass-based FilterConfig, environment variable support, and performance profile switching
4.5. Write unit tests for backward compatibility layer covering all existing public APIs and filter combinations from original filters.py
4.6. Implement compatibility layer in filters/compatibility/legacy.py that maintains 100% API compatibility with existing code
4.7. Write performance benchmark tests comparing refactored implementation against original monolithic version for all filter operations
4.8. Verify all advanced features tests pass, configuration system works correctly, and performance benchmarks show no regression

### 5. Integration and Validation

**Goal**: Complete end-to-end testing, documentation, and final validation of the entire refactored filter system.

5.1. Write comprehensive integration tests covering complex filter chains, SVG parsing workflows, and real-world usage scenarios
5.2. Create test fixtures with diverse SVG samples and expected outputs for regression testing and continuous validation
5.3. Implement memory profiling and performance monitoring with built-in timing decorators and bottleneck identification
5.4. Run full test suite achieving minimum 85% overall code coverage with 100% coverage on core interfaces and critical paths
5.5. Generate comprehensive developer documentation for each module, interface, and configuration option using automated tools
5.6. Perform final validation by running existing codebase against refactored filter system through compatibility layer
5.7. Create migration guide and rollback plan with feature flags for gradual adoption and automated fallback mechanisms
5.8. Verify complete system integration, all tests pass, documentation is complete, and performance meets or exceeds original implementation
