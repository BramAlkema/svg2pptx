> Spec: Filters Refactoring
> Created: 2025-09-14
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Complete refactoring of the monolithic 4000-line filters.py file into a modular, maintainable architecture. This comprehensive restructure will break down the complex filtering system into logical components, improving code organization, testability, and development velocity.

## User Stories

As a developer, I want the filter system broken into logical modules so that I can understand and modify specific filtering functionality without navigating through thousands of lines of code.

As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests for each filter component so that I can confidently make changes without breaking existing functionality.

As a developer, I want clear interfaces between filter components so that I can add new filters or modify existing ones with minimal impact on other parts of the system.

As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging throughout the filter system so that I can quickly diagnose and fix issues during development.

As a developer, I want documentation for each filter module so that I can understand the purpose and usage of different filtering components.

## Spec Scope

1. **Module Decomposition**: Break down the 4000-line filters.py into logical, single-responsibility modules based on filter types and functionality
2. **Interface Standardization**: Create consistent interfaces and base classes for all filter components to ensure uniform behavior and extensibility
3. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Implement unit tests for each refactored module with 90%+ code coverage and integration tests for filter chains
4. **Configuration Management**: Extract hardcoded values into configuration files and implement a centralized configuration system for all filters
5. **Performance Optimization**: Identify and eliminate redundant operations, implement caching where appropriate, and optimize filter execution order

## Out of Scope

- Adding new filter functionality or features beyond the existing capabilities
- Changing the external API or user-facing interfaces of the filter system
- Performance benchmarking or load testing (focus is on code structure, not performance metrics)
- Database schema changes or data migration procedures
- User interface modifications or frontend changes

## Expected Deliverable

A completely refactored filter system with:
- Modular architecture with 8-12 focused modules replacing the monolithic file
- 90%+ unit test coverage across all refactored components
- Integration tests demonstrating filter chain functionality works identically to the original system
- Configuration system allowing easy modification of filter parameters without code changes
- Comprehensive developer documentation for each module and interface
- Performance that matches or exceeds the original monolithic implementation
