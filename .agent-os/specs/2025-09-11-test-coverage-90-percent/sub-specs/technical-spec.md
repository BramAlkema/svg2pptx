# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-11-test-coverage-90-percent/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Test Coverage Infrastructure
- **pytest-cov** integration for automated coverage measurement and reporting
- **coverage.py** configuration with 90% minimum threshold enforcement
- **CI/CD pipeline integration** with coverage gates preventing deployments below threshold
- **Coverage reporting** with HTML and XML output formats for visualization and integration

### End-to-End Test Framework
- **SVG test corpus** with comprehensive sample files covering all supported SVG features
- **Reference PPTX validation** using automated comparison against known-good outputs
- **Visual regression testing** with image comparison algorithms for layout accuracy
- **Workflow validation** testing complete SVG→DrawML→PPTX conversion pipelines

### Core Parser Testing Architecture
- **Unit tests** for individual SVG element parsers (shapes, text, gradients, transforms)
- **Integration tests** for parser combinations and nested element handling
- **Edge case validation** for malformed SVG inputs and boundary conditions
- **Error handling verification** ensuring graceful degradation and informative error messages

### Accuracy Measurement Systems
- **DrawML validation** against PowerPoint specifications and reference implementations
- **Visual fidelity metrics** measuring conversion accuracy through automated image analysis
- **Performance benchmarking** with conversion speed and memory usage tracking
- **Regression detection** comparing outputs across code changes

### Test Data Management
- **Structured test assets** organized by SVG feature complexity and conversion difficulty
- **Automated test generation** for parametric testing across SVG variations
- **Reference output management** with version-controlled expected results
- **Test result archiving** for historical comparison and trend analysis

### Coverage Analysis Tools
- **Module-level reporting** showing coverage breakdown by conversion component
- **Line-level analysis** identifying uncovered code paths in critical areas
- **Branch coverage verification** ensuring all conditional logic paths are tested
- **Function coverage validation** confirming all public APIs have test coverage
