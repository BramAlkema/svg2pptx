# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: 90% Test Coverage Implementation
> Created: 2025-09-11
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement comprehensive test coverage reaching 90% across the SVG2PPTX conversion system with focus on end-to-end accuracy testing, core SVG parsing validation, and DrawML conversion reliability. This specification ensures production-ready quality through systematic testing of all critical conversion pathways and edge cases.

## User Stories

### Quality Assurance Engineer Story

As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive test coverage across all conversion scenarios, so that I can confidently validate that SVG files convert accurately to PowerPoint presentations without visual or structural degradation.

The testing system should validate complete workflows from SVG input through DrawML generation to final PPTX output, including complex SVG features like gradients, transforms, text paths, and nested groups. All edge cases and error conditions must be covered to prevent production failures.

### Developer Story

As a developer working on the conversion engine, I want detailed test feedback on parsing accuracy and conversion fidelity, so that I can quickly identify and fix issues in the SVG-to-DrawML translation logic.

The test suite should provide granular feedback on which SVG elements are processed correctly, measure conversion accuracy against reference outputs, and validate that complex SVG constructs maintain their visual properties through the conversion pipeline.

### DevOps Engineer Story

As a DevOps engineer, I want automated test coverage reporting integrated into CI/CD pipelines, so that I can ensure code quality gates are met before deployment and track coverage trends over time.

The testing infrastructure should generate detailed coverage reports, integrate with automated build processes, and provide clear metrics on test completion rates and conversion accuracy benchmarks.

## Spec Scope

1. **End-to-End Conversion Testing** - Complete SVG to PPTX workflow validation with visual accuracy verification
2. **Core SVG Parser Coverage** - Comprehensive testing of all supported SVG elements, attributes, and structures
3. **DrawML Generation Accuracy** - Validation of SVG-to-DrawML conversion fidelity and PowerPoint compatibility
4. **Edge Case Handling** - Systematic testing of malformed inputs, boundary conditions, and error scenarios
5. **Performance and Regression Testing** - Automated benchmarking and change impact validation
6. **Coverage Reporting Infrastructure** - Automated measurement and reporting reaching 90% target coverage

## Out of Scope

- Google Apps Script testing (focus on Python conversion engine)
- Manual testing procedures (emphasis on automated test suites)
- Load testing and stress testing (covered in separate performance specs)
- UI testing for any web interfaces
- Third-party library testing (focus on SVG2PPTX specific logic)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **90% Test Coverage Achievement** - Measurable coverage across all core conversion modules with automated reporting
2. **End-to-End Test Suite** - Complete workflow validation from SVG input to PPTX output with accuracy metrics
3. **Comprehensive Parser Testing** - Full coverage of SVG element parsing with edge case validation and error handling verification
