# Text-to-Path Fallback System - Lite Summary

A robust fallback system that converts SVG text elements to vector paths when fonts are unavailable or exact visual fidelity is required, ensuring consistent text rendering across all PowerPoint environments.

## Key Points
- Automatically detects when text-to-path conversion is needed (missing fonts, complex layouts)
- Extracts font metrics and generates accurate glyph outlines as PowerPoint path shapes
- Maintains all text properties including positioning, formatting, decorations, and multi-line layouts
- Integrates seamlessly with existing TextConverter as a transparent fallback mechanism
- Preserves visual fidelity while providing vector scalability and cross-platform compatibility
