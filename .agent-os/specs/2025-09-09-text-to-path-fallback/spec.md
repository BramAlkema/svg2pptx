> Spec: Text-to-Path Fallback System for SVG2PPTX
> Created: 2025-09-09
> Status: Planning

## Overview

The SVG2PPTX converter currently handles SVG text elements by converting them to PowerPoint text shapes using the TextConverter class. However, this approach has limitations when:

1. **Font Availability**: The specified font is not available in the PowerPoint environment
2. **Visual Fidelity**: Complex text layouts or special typography require exact rendering
3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Text rendering differs across platforms and PowerPoint versions
4. **Advanced Typography**: Special characters, custom fonts, or complex text paths need precise reproduction

This spec defines a robust text-to-path fallback system that converts SVG text elements to vector paths when text-based rendering is insufficient or unavailable. The system will maintain visual fidelity by extracting font metrics, generating glyph outlines, and creating PowerPoint path shapes that precisely replicate the original SVG text appearance.

## User Stories

**As a user converting SVG files to PowerPoint**, I want:
- Text to render correctly even when the original fonts are not available on the target system
- Complex typography and custom fonts to maintain their visual appearance in PowerPoint
- Text decorations and special formatting to be preserved as vector graphics
- Multi-line text and complex layouts to be accurately reproduced
- The conversion process to automatically fallback to path-based rendering when needed

**As a developer integrating the SVG2PPTX library**, I want:
- A transparent fallback system that automatically handles font availability issues
- Configuration options to force text-to-path conversion for specific scenarios
- Performance optimization to only use path conversion when necessary
- Comprehensive error handling for edge cases in font processing

**As a PowerPoint user receiving converted files**, I want:
- Text to appear exactly as designed in the original SVG
- Vector-based text paths to scale properly when resizing presentations
- Consistent rendering across different PowerPoint versions and platforms
- Searchable text content preserved when possible through hidden text layers

## Spec Scope

### Core Functionality
- **Font Detection and Fallback Logic**: Determine when text-to-path conversion is necessary
- **Glyph Extraction**: Extract individual character shapes from font files or system fonts
- **Path Generation**: Convert text glyphs to SVG paths and then to PowerPoint drawing paths
- **Layout Preservation**: Maintain text positioning, kerning, and multi-line layouts
- **Integration with TextConverter**: Seamless fallback mechanism in existing text conversion pipeline

### Text Properties Support
- **Font Properties**: Family, size, weight (normal, bold), style (normal, italic, oblique)
- **Text Positioning**: x, y coordinates, text-anchor (start, middle, end)
- **Text Decorations**: Underline, strikethrough, overline
- **Advanced Formatting**: Letter-spacing, word-spacing, text-transform
- **Multi-line Text**: Line breaks, tspan elements, dy positioning

### PowerPoint Integration
- **Path Shape Generation**: Create DrawingML path shapes for text outlines
- **Fill and Stroke**: Apply original text colors and effects to path shapes
- **Transformation Support**: Maintain rotations, scaling, and other transformations
- **Layering**: Preserve text stacking order and z-index behavior

### Performance Optimization
- **Caching System**: Cache generated paths for repeated text/font combinations
- **Selective Conversion**: Only convert to paths when necessary (font unavailable, complex layout)
- **Memory Management**: Efficient handling of font data and glyph information

## Out of Scope

- **Font Installation**: This system will not install missing fonts on the target system
- **OCR Functionality**: No optical character recognition for bitmap text
- **Text Editing**: Generated paths will not be editable as text in PowerPoint
- **Font Licensing**: No validation of font licensing for path conversion
- **RTL Text Support**: Right-to-left text rendering is not included in initial implementation
- **Advanced Typography**: Complex features like ligatures, kerning tables not fully supported initially

## Expected Deliverable

A comprehensive text-to-path fallback system that integrates with the existing SVG2PPTX TextConverter, providing:

1. **TextToPathConverter Class**: New converter class that handles glyph-to-path conversion
2. **FontMetricsAnalyzer**: Utility class for extracting font metrics and glyph data
3. **PathGenerator**: Converts text glyphs to PowerPoint-compatible path definitions
4. **Enhanced TextConverter**: Updated to include fallback logic and path integration
5. **Configuration System**: Options to control when text-to-path conversion is triggered
6. **Test Suite**: Comprehensive tests covering various fonts, text layouts, and edge cases
7. **Documentation**: Usage examples, configuration options, and troubleshooting guide

The system should maintain backward compatibility with existing SVG files while providing enhanced rendering capabilities for complex text scenarios.
