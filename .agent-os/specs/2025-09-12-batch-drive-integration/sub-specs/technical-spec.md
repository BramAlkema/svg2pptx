# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-12-batch-drive-integration/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-12
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **Authentication Integration** - Extend batch processing endpoints to use existing Google Drive authentication (OAuth 2.0 and service account) from the single-file conversion system
- **Folder Structure Management** - Implement hierarchical folder creation logic with pattern `SVG2PPTX-Batches/{YYYY-MM-DD}/batch-{job-id}/` for organized file storage
- **Async Upload Integration** - Add Google Drive upload tasks to existing Huey task queue system alongside conversion tasks to maintain non-blocking batch processing
- **File Naming Strategy** - Preserve original SVG file names in PowerPoint outputs and maintain ZIP folder structure when applicable
- **Response Schema Enhancement** - Extend existing batch response models to include Google Drive file IDs, sharing URLs, and preview URLs alongside local download links
- **Preview Generation Pipeline** - Integrate Google Slides API preview generation for each converted PowerPoint file in the batch, similar to single-file conversion
- **Error Handling Extension** - Handle Google Drive API failures gracefully with fallback to local-only results and detailed per-file error reporting
- **Configuration Management** - Add batch-specific Google Drive settings (folder naming patterns, sharing permissions) to existing environment configuration
- **Cleanup Integration** - Extend existing temporary file cleanup to include Google Drive upload status tracking and retry logic
- **Rate Limiting Compliance** - Implement Google Drive API rate limiting awareness for batch uploads to prevent quota exhaustion
- **Progress Tracking Enhancement** - Update batch job status tracking to include Google Drive upload progress alongside conversion progress
- **ZIP Structure Preservation** - For ZIP uploads, recreate original folder structure within the Google Drive batch folder while maintaining flat access for individual files

## Approach

The implementation will leverage existing Google Drive integration components from the single-file conversion system and extend the current batch processing architecture to include Drive upload capabilities.

## External Dependencies

- Google Drive API v3
- Google Slides API (for preview generation)
- Existing OAuth 2.0 authentication system
- Huey task queue system
