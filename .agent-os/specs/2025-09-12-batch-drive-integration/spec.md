# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Google Drive Integration for Batch Processing
> Created: 2025-09-12

## Overview

Extend the existing batch processing API with Google Drive integration to automatically upload converted PowerPoint files and organize them in structured folders. This feature will provide the same Google Drive capabilities available in single-file conversion to batch processing users, enabling seamless workflow integration with Google Workspace.

## User Stories

### Content Creator Batch Upload

As a content creator, I want to convert multiple SVG files and have them automatically organized in Google Drive folders, so that I can easily access and share the results with my team without manual file management.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User uploads multiple SVG files via batch processing endpoint
2. System converts all files to PowerPoint format
3. System creates organized folder structure in Google Drive
4. System uploads all converted files with proper naming
5. System generates PNG previews via Google Slides API
6. User receives structured response with Drive links and preview URLs

### Design Agency Batch Processing

As a design agency, I want to process client SVG assets in batches with automatic Google Drive organization, so that I can deliver organized presentation files directly to client Drive folders.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Agency uploads ZIP file containing client SVG assets
2. System processes all files maintaining folder structure
3. System creates client-specific folder in Google Drive
4. System uploads converted files with metadata preservation
5. Client receives access to organized Drive folder with all deliverables

## Spec Scope

1. **Drive Upload Integration** - Extend batch endpoints to automatically upload results to Google Drive using existing OAuth/service account authentication
2. **Folder Organization** - Create structured folder hierarchies based on batch job IDs, timestamps, and optional user-specified folder names
3. **Preview Generation** - Generate PNG previews for batch-converted PowerPoint files using Google Slides API integration
4. **Metadata Preservation** - Maintain original file names, folder structures (for ZIP uploads), and conversion metadata in Drive organization
5. **Response Enhancement** - Extend batch API responses to include Google Drive file IDs, sharing URLs, and preview URLs alongside existing local download links

## Out of Scope

- Real-time folder sharing with specific Google accounts (users can share manually)
- Custom Drive folder templates or branding
- Advanced Drive permissions management beyond basic upload
- Integration with Google Workspace admin controls
- Batch processing of non-SVG files

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Enhanced Batch Endpoints** - All existing batch processing endpoints (`/batch/convert-files`, `/batch/convert-zip`, `/batch/simple/*`) include optional Google Drive upload with organized folder structure
2. **Drive Folder Management** - System creates logical folder hierarchies (e.g., `SVG2PPTX-Batches/2025-09-12/batch-{job-id}/`) with proper file organization
3. **Complete API Response** - Batch status and result endpoints return both local download links and Google Drive links with preview URLs for comprehensive access options
