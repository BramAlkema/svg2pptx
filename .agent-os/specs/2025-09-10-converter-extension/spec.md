> Spec: SVG Converter Extension and Missing Element Support
> Created: 2025-09-10
> Status: Planning

## Overview

This spec addresses the need to extend the current SVG to PowerPoint converter system by:

1. **Extending existing shape converters** - Adding missing SVG shape elements to the shapes.py converter (line, polyline improvements, and other basic shapes)
2. **Implementing missing SVG converters** - Creating new converters for currently unsupported SVG elements (image, use, symbol, defs, pattern, clipPath, filter, etc.)
3. **Establishing converter development patterns** - Standardizing how new converters integrate with the BaseConverter pattern and universal utility system

The converter architecture is already well-established with a modular BaseConverter pattern, comprehensive universal utilities (ColorParser, UnitConverter, TransformParser, ViewportResolver), and a ConverterRegistry system. This spec focuses on systematic expansion to achieve comprehensive SVG element coverage.

## User Stories

**As a developer using the SVG converter system:**
- I want all basic SVG shape elements to be supported so that simple SVG graphics convert completely
- I want missing SVG elements (image, use, symbol, etc.) to be converted rather than ignored
- I want consistent converter implementation patterns so that extending the system is predictable

**As a user converting SVG files:**
- I want comprehensive SVG element support so that my graphics convert with high fidelity
- I want embedded images and symbols to be preserved in PowerPoint output
- I want complex SVG features like patterns and clipping paths to have reasonable fallbacks

**As a maintainer of the converter system:**
- I want clear guidelines for implementing new converters
- I want all converters to follow the same integration patterns with the universal utility system
- I want comprehensive test coverage for new converters

## Spec Scope

### In Scope

1. **Shape Converter Extensions**
   - Complete line element support in shapes.py (currently basic implementation exists)
   - Enhanced polyline support with proper path generation
   - Addition of any missing basic shape elements

2. **New Converter Implementation**
   - ImageConverter for `<image>` elements
   - UseConverter for `<use>` element references
   - SymbolConverter for `<symbol>` definitions
   - DefsConverter for `<defs>` processing
   - PatternConverter for `<pattern>` fills
   - ClipPathConverter for `<clipPath>` masking
   - FilterConverter for `<filter>` effects (with fallbacks)

3. **Converter Infrastructure**
   - Standardized converter implementation guidelines
   - Integration patterns with universal utilities
   - Error handling and fallback strategies
   - Registration and discovery mechanisms

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Comprehensive test cases for each new converter
   - Integration tests with universal utilities
   - SVG parsing and DrawingML generation validation

### Implementation Priority

**Phase 1: Shape Extensions (High Priority)**
- Complete LineConverter implementation
- Enhanced PolygonConverter/PolylineConverter

**Phase 2: Reference Elements (High Priority)**  
- ImageConverter
- UseConverter
- SymbolConverter

**Phase 3: Advanced Features (Medium Priority)**
- DefsConverter
- PatternConverter  
- ClipPathConverter

**Phase 4: Effects (Lower Priority)**
- FilterConverter with basic fallbacks

## Out of Scope

- Complex SVG animation elements (`<animate>`, `<animateTransform>`) - handled by existing animations.py
- SVG scripting elements (`<script>`)
- Complex filter effects beyond basic fallbacks
- SVG font elements (already covered by font-related converters)
- Modification of existing converter core logic (only extensions)
- Changes to the BaseConverter interface or universal utility APIs

## Expected Deliverable

A comprehensive converter extension that:

1. **Extends shapes.py** with complete support for all basic SVG shape elements
2. **Implements missing element converters** following the established BaseConverter pattern
3. **Provides clear implementation guidelines** for future converter development
4. **Includes comprehensive test coverage** for all new converters
5. **Maintains backward compatibility** with existing converter functionality
6. **Integrates seamlessly** with the universal utility system (ColorParser, UnitConverter, TransformParser, ViewportResolver)

The deliverable should result in significantly improved SVG element coverage while maintaining the high-quality, modular architecture already established.
