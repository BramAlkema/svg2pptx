These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-09-missing-svg-elements-tests/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-09
> Status: Ready for Implementation

## Tasks

### 1. Set Up Test Infrastructure for Missing SVG Elements

- [ ] Write comprehensive test suite structure for missing SVG elements coverage
- [ ] Create test utilities for SVG parsing and validation
- [ ] Set up test data directory with sample SVG files for each missing element
- [ ] Implement test fixtures for PPTX output validation
- [ ] Create helper functions for comparing expected vs actual PPTX content
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline integration for automated test execution
- [ ] Document test naming conventions and organization patterns
- [ ] Verify all test infrastructure components work correctly

### 2. Implement Tests for Critical Priority Elements

- [ ] Write tests for `image` element handling and PPTX conversion
- [ ] Write tests for `feDropShadow` filter effect rendering
- [ ] Write tests for `tspan` text span element positioning and styling
- [ ] Write tests for `polyline` shape conversion to PPTX equivalent
- [ ] Implement edge case tests for each critical element (empty attributes, invalid values)
- [ ] Create integration tests combining multiple critical elements in single SVG
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks for critical element processing
- [ ] Verify all critical priority element tests pass

### 3. Implement Tests for High Priority Elements

- [ ] Write tests for `symbol` definition and `use` element instantiation
- [ ] Write tests for `feGaussianBlur` filter effect application
- [ ] Write tests for `pattern` fill and stroke pattern rendering
- [ ] Write tests for `style` element CSS parsing and application
- [ ] Create complex scenario tests combining high priority elements
- [ ] Implement tests for nested and referenced high priority elements
- [ ] Add validation for proper PPTX shape hierarchy generation
- [ ] Verify all high priority element tests pass

### 4. Complete Medium Priority Elements and Finalize Coverage

- [ ] Write tests for remaining medium priority elements (svg root, defs)
- [ ] Create comprehensive integration tests using all missing elements together
- [ ] Implement regression tests for previously working SVG features
- [ ] Add test coverage reporting and analysis tools
- [ ] Create test documentation with examples and expected outcomes
- [ ] Perform end-to-end validation with real-world SVG samples
- [ ] Generate final test coverage report showing 100% missing element coverage
- [ ] Verify all tests pass and meet quality standards
