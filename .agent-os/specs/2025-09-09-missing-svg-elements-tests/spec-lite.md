# Missing SVG Elements Tests - Lite Summary

Create a comprehensive test suite for the 10 most critical missing SVG elements in the SVG2PPTX converter to guide implementation priorities and achieve 90%+ SVG compatibility. This test-driven development approach will establish thorough test coverage before implementation, enabling the converter to improve from its current 55% overall compatibility to handle complex SVG files with polylines, text spans, images, symbols, patterns, and filters. The deliverable includes 150+ test cases with clear success criteria, providing a measurable path toward seamless SVG-to-PowerPoint conversion.

## Key Points
- Establish test-driven development for 10 critical missing SVG elements (polyline, tspan, image, symbol+use, pattern, filters, etc.)
- Improve SVG compatibility from current 55% to target 90%+ through comprehensive test coverage
- Create priority-based implementation roadmap with 150+ test cases covering basic functionality, edge cases, and visual regression testing
