> Spec: Missing SVG Elements Tests
> Created: 2025-09-09
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Create a comprehensive test suite for the 10 most critical missing SVG elements in the SVG2PPTX converter to guide implementation priorities and achieve 90%+ SVG compatibility. Currently, the converter achieves only 55% overall compatibility and 71% for presentation-critical elements, significantly limiting its effectiveness for real-world SVG files.

This spec focuses on establishing test-driven development practices by creating thorough test coverage for missing SVG elements before implementation, ensuring each element is properly handled with edge cases covered and providing clear success criteria for development work.

## User Stories

**As a developer working on SVG2PPTX compatibility**, I want comprehensive tests for missing SVG elements so that I can implement features with confidence and clear acceptance criteria.

**As a user of SVG2PPTX**, I want the converter to handle complex SVG files with polylines, text spans, images, symbols, patterns, and filters so that my converted presentations maintain visual fidelity.

**As a project maintainer**, I want a priority-based roadmap for implementing missing SVG elements so that development effort focuses on the highest-impact features first.

**As a quality assurance engineer**, I want thorough test coverage for SVG element edge cases so that regressions are caught early and compatibility improvements are measurable.

## Spec Scope

**In Scope:**
- Create comprehensive test suites for 10 critical missing SVG elements:
  - `polyline` - Multi-point line drawings
  - `tspan` - Text span formatting within text elements
  - `image` - Embedded raster images
  - `symbol` + `use` - Reusable graphic definitions and instances
  - `pattern` - Fill and stroke patterns
  - `feGaussianBlur` - Gaussian blur filter effect
  - `feDropShadow` - Drop shadow filter effect
  - `svg` root - Root SVG container element handling
  - `defs` - Definitions container for reusable elements
  - `style` - CSS styling within SVG

- Test coverage includes:
  - Basic functionality tests
  - Edge case handling
  - Attribute combination testing
  - Integration with existing supported elements
  - Error handling and fallback behavior

- Priority-based implementation roadmap based on:
  - Frequency of element usage in real SVG files
  - Impact on visual fidelity
  - Implementation complexity
  - Dependencies between elements

- Success metrics and compatibility measurement framework

**Testing Framework Requirements:**
- Unit tests for each SVG element parser
- Integration tests for element combinations
- Visual regression tests comparing SVG input to PPTX output
- Performance benchmarks for processing complex SVG files

## Out of Scope

- Implementation of the actual SVG elements (this spec focuses on tests only)
- Testing of already supported SVG elements
- Advanced filter effects beyond `feGaussianBlur` and `feDropShadow`
- Animation-related SVG elements (`animate`, `animateTransform`, etc.)
- Complex text layout elements beyond `tspan`
- SVG 2.0 specific features
- Performance optimization of existing code
- User interface changes or API modifications

## Expected Deliverable

**Primary Deliverable:**
A comprehensive test suite covering all 10 critical missing SVG elements, with each element having:
- Minimum 15 test cases covering basic functionality and edge cases
- Visual regression test files (SVG inputs with expected PPTX outputs)
- Performance benchmark tests
- Error handling and validation tests

**Supporting Deliverables:**
- Priority-based implementation roadmap document ranking elements by impact and complexity
- Test data repository with diverse SVG files containing target elements
- Compatibility measurement framework to track progress toward 90% goal
- Documentation of current parser gaps and implementation requirements

**Success Criteria:**
- 150+ new test cases added to the test suite
- All tests initially fail (confirming missing functionality)
- Clear specification for each element's expected behavior in PPTX conversion
- Measurable path from current 55% compatibility to target 90% compatibility
- Development team can implement elements using test-driven development approach
