# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Test Coverage Improvement to 90%
> Created: 2025-09-11

## Overview

Systematically improve SVG2PPTX test coverage from the current 38.33% to 90% through targeted test enhancements, failing test fixes, and comprehensive coverage monitoring. This initiative will leverage the existing robust test infrastructure (583+ passing tests) while addressing coverage gaps through a phased approach that ensures production readiness and code reliability.

## User Stories

### Quality Assurance Engineer Story
As a QA engineer, I want comprehensive test coverage so that I can confidently validate SVG conversion functionality before releases and catch regressions early.

The QA team needs systematic coverage across all converter modules (shapes, paths, text, gradients), API endpoints, and integration services. Current 38.33% coverage leaves critical code paths untested, creating risk for production issues and making thorough validation difficult.

### Developer Story  
As a developer, I want reliable test coverage feedback so that I can refactor and enhance the codebase without fear of breaking existing functionality.

Developers need confidence that changes to converter logic, API services, or utility functions won't introduce regressions. Comprehensive test coverage provides this safety net while enabling rapid development and code improvements.

### DevOps Engineer Story
As a DevOps engineer, I want automated coverage monitoring so that I can enforce quality gates in CI/CD and prevent coverage regression over time.

The deployment pipeline needs measurable quality metrics that support release decisions and demonstrate code reliability. Having 90% test coverage provides quantifiable assurance for production deployments and supports continuous delivery practices.

## Spec Scope

1. **Failing Test Resolution** - Fix the 25+ currently failing tests to establish a solid baseline and recover lost coverage opportunities
2. **Converter Module Enhancement** - Achieve 95% coverage on core converter modules (shapes, paths, text, gradients, transforms) through comprehensive functional testing  
3. **API Service Layer Testing** - Implement 90% coverage for FastAPI endpoints, authentication, and service integrations with Google Drive/Slides APIs
4. **Coverage Monitoring Integration** - Establish automated coverage tracking in CI/CD with quality gates and regression prevention
5. **Test Infrastructure Optimization** - Enhance existing test patterns with property-based testing, mutation testing, and automated test generation

## Out of Scope

- Complete rewrite of existing test infrastructure (leverage existing 583+ tests)
- Visual regression testing implementation (separate initiative) 
- Performance load testing (handled by existing benchmark suite)
- Test framework migration (pytest ecosystem works well)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Achieve and maintain 90% overall test coverage with automated CI/CD monitoring and quality gates that prevent regression
2. All currently failing tests fixed and passing, with comprehensive test suite covering critical user journeys and edge cases
3. Enhanced test infrastructure with advanced testing patterns (property-based, mutation testing) and comprehensive documentation for maintenance
