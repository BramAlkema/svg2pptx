# SVG Filter Effects Pipeline - Lite Summary

Build a comprehensive SVG filter effects processing system with PowerPoint compatibility using a three-tier fallback strategy (native OOXML → DML hacks → rasterization). Development must religiously follow the templated testing system to ensure robust filter effect conversion across all PowerPoint versions and scenarios.

## Key Points
- Three-tier fallback strategy for maximum PowerPoint compatibility
- Native OOXML effects with DML hack fallbacks and rasterization safety net
- Mandatory templated testing system usage throughout development
