## Implementation Notes

- **Test-First Approach:** Every task begins with comprehensive test creation using our templated testing system
- **Dependencies:** Tasks should be completed in order due to technical dependencies
- **Quality Gates:** Each task must pass all tests before proceeding to the next
- **Performance Targets:** All implementations must meet performance benchmarks defined in technical spec
- **Documentation:** Code should be self-documenting with comprehensive inline documentation
