> Spec: SVG Filter Effects Pipeline with OOXML Effect Mapping
> Created: 2025-09-14
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive SVG filter effects processing pipeline that converts complex SVG filter primitives to PowerPoint-compatible effects with multiple fallback strategies. The system will handle all major SVG filter elements (feGaussianBlur, feDropShadow, feOffset, feMorphology, feColorMatrix, etc.) and map them to OOXML effects using three strategies: native effects, PowerPoint hacks, and raster fallbacks.

The pipeline will include effect chaining capabilities, proper coordinate system transformations, and a templated testing framework to ensure visual fidelity across all supported filter types.

## User Stories

**As a developer converting SVG files to PowerPoint presentations, I want:**
- To convert SVG files containing advanced filter effects (blur, drop shadow, lighting effects) to PowerPoint slides while maintaining visual fidelity
- Multiple fallback strategies when native OOXML effects cannot accurately represent complex SVG filters
- Proper handling of filter effect chaining and composition modes
- Automated testing that validates visual output across different filter combinations

**As a PowerPoint user receiving converted presentations, I want:**
- Filter effects to render consistently across different PowerPoint versions and platforms
- Performance-optimized effects that don't slow down presentation playback
- Fallback to raster images when complex effects cannot be represented natively

**As a system integrator, I want:**
- A modular filter pipeline that can be extended with new filter primitives
- Clear documentation of which SVG filters map to which OOXML effects
- Comprehensive test coverage for all supported filter combinations

## Spec Scope

### Core Filter Primitive Support
- **feGaussianBlur**: Gaussian blur effects with proper radius mapping
- **feDropShadow**: Drop shadow effects with offset, blur, and color
- **feOffset**: Element displacement and positioning
- **feMorphology**: Dilate and erode operations
- **feColorMatrix**: Color transformations and adjustments
- **feFlood**: Solid color generation
- **feComposite**: Blending and composition operations
- **feTurbulence**: Noise and texture generation
- **feConvolveMatrix**: Convolution-based effects
- **feLighting**: Diffuse and specular lighting effects

### Effect Mapping Strategies
1. **Native OOXML Effects**: Direct mapping to PowerPoint's built-in effects
2. **PowerPoint Hacks**: Creative workarounds using multiple OOXML elements
3. **Raster Fallbacks**: Server-side rendering to images when effects cannot be represented

### Filter Pipeline Components
- **Filter Parser**: SVG filter element parsing and validation
- **Effect Chain Builder**: Constructs effect chains from filter primitives
- **OOXML Mapper**: Maps filter effects to PowerPoint elements
- **Coordinate Transformer**: Handles coordinate system conversions
- **Fallback Manager**: Determines optimal rendering strategy

### Testing Framework
- **Templated Test Generation**: Automated test case creation for filter combinations
- **Visual Regression Testing**: Comparison of rendered outputs
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Effect rendering performance validation
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Testing across PowerPoint versions

## Out of Scope

- **Advanced 3D Effects**: Complex 3D transformations and lighting models
- **Custom Filter Primitives**: Non-standard SVG filter elements
- **Animation Effects**: Animated filter parameters (static effects only)
- **Interactive Effects**: Hover or click-triggered filter changes
- **Video Filter Effects**: Filters applied to embedded video content

## Expected Deliverable

A complete SVG filter effects processing pipeline that:

1. **Parses and validates** all major SVG filter primitives with proper error handling
2. **Maps filter effects** to OOXML using three-tier fallback strategy (native → hack → raster)
3. **Handles effect chaining** with proper composition and blending modes
4. **Provides coordinate transformation** between SVG and PowerPoint coordinate systems
5. **Includes comprehensive testing** with templated test generation and visual validation
6. **Maintains performance** with optimized effect rendering and caching
7. **Supports extensibility** through modular architecture for adding new filter types

The pipeline should integrate seamlessly with the existing svg2pptx conversion system and provide clear logging and debugging capabilities for troubleshooting complex filter conversions.
