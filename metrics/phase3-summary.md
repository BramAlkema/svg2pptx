# Phase 3 Metrics Summary

## Complexity (radon `cc`)
- `core/pipeline/converter.py` dropped from **F (42)** to **E (38)** after delegating responsibilities to helper modules.
- New hotspots surfaced:
  - `core/pipeline/resource_manager.py::prepare_embedded_fonts` at **F (52)**.
  - `core/services/font_embedding_engine.py::prepare_embedded_fonts` still **F (52)**, indicating overlapping logic that needs further decomposition or tighter unit coverage.

## Maintainability (radon `mi`)
- `core/pipeline/converter.py` improved from **9.81 (grade B)** to **26.64 (grade A)**.
- `core/pipeline/resource_manager.py` lands at **26.03 (grade A)** but is now the lowest-scoring module in the new slice; further refactoring/testing recommended.
- Most other modules remain ≥40 (grade A), matching the pre-refactor baselines.

## LOC Distribution
- Total lines in `core/parse/parser.py` reduced from ~2,000 to ~660.
- New `core/parse_split/` package now hosts ~1,100 lines spread across helpers (`xml_parser`, `validator`, `clip_parser`, `style_context`, `ir_converter`).

## Next Steps
1. Target the new complexity hotspots (resource manager + font embedding engine) with additional extraction/tests.
2. Raise unit/integration coverage for `core/parse_split/*` helpers to close the gap toward the 96% coverage target.
3. Align performance benchmarking (Task 3.5) and documentation updates (Task 3.6) with these findings.
